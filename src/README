ConMan is a serial console management program designed to support a large
number of console devices and simultaneous users.  It supports:
  - local serial devices
  - remote terminal servers (via the telnet protocol)
  - IPMI Serial-Over-LAN (via FreeIPMI)
  - Unix domain sockets
  - external processes (eg, using Expect for telnet/ssh/ipmi-sol connections)

Its features include:
  - logging (and optionally timestamping) console device output to file
  - connecting to consoles in monitor (R/O) or interactive (R/W) mode
  - allowing clients to share or steal console write privileges
  - broadcasting client output to multiple consoles
